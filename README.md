# CLEAN Scraper Project

Welcome to the `clean-scraper` project!

This repo contains scrapers to gather police bodycam video footage and other files from police department websites, as part of the Community Law Enforcement Accountability Network (CLEAN).

The CLEAN project is a collaborative effort between [Big Local News][], at Stanford, the [UC Berkeley Investigative Reporting Program][], and a variety of civil liberty organizations and news partners around the country. We're gathering police body camera footage, disciplinary records and other important information to help shine a light on the use of harmful and lethal force by law enforcement.

Our accountability reporting has produced a number of [news stories](docs/stories.md) already, but there's still much work to be done.

We welcome open-source contributions to this project. Or if you'd just like to nab our code for your own purposes, you're welcome to do so.

Please check out the resources below to get started:
