# CLEAN scrapers

This repo contains scrapers to gather police bodycam video footage and other files from police department websites, as part of the Community Law Enforcement Accountability Network.

We welcome open-source contributions to this project. If you'd like to pitch in, check out the [ever-growing list of agencies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTBcJKRsufBPYLsX92ZhaHrjV7Qv1THMO4EBhOCmEos4ayv6yB6d9-VXlaKNr5FGaViP20qXbUvJXgL/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true) we need to scrape and ping us in Discussions :point_up: to claim an agency.

> :warning: This is a new scraping effort (as of March 2024). We're planning to provide Developer guidelines and sample code in the near future. In the meantime, please ping if you have questions about how to get started.


## Scrapers

- San Diego, CA
  - In `sd_scrape` the scraper is being built out for all pages.
  - In `sd_scrape_test` one page of the scraper is isolated in order to build out and test parts of the scraper without having to download/pull all files and wait.
